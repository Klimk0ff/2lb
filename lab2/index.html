            Of course, you know the story of a tiny girl who was born from a flower and became friends with a swallow. Thumbelina is the heroine of Andersen's fairy tale, well known to adults and children. But, if you think about it, Thumbelina can be so different! Whoever portrayed her in the pictures - timid and courageous, shy and decisive, cheerful and sad. Each artist creates his own image of a girl from a flower - and each time a new fairy tale turns out.

            <h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>
            <img class="BookImage" align="left" src="https://img.yakaboo.ua/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/398x565/234c7c011ba026e66d29567e1be1d1f7/3/3/334021_32349749.jpg" alt="The Ugly Duckling" width="100px">
            Perhaps of all the stories written by the Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, The Ugly Duckling has the happiest ending. Maybe that's why both children and adults love her so much. After all, not only boys and girls want to believe that Fairy Princes are waiting for Cinderellas, but Lovely Swans grow from the Ugly Ducklings!
