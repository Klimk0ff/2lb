      Perhaps of all the stories written by the Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, The Ugly Duckling has the happiest ending. Maybe that's why both children and adults love her so much. After all, not only boys and girls want to believe that Fairy Princes are waiting for Cinderellas, but Lovely Swans grow from the Ugly Ducklings!
      Illustrations by the wonderful artist Anton Lomaev helped the famous Andersen fairy tale become especially bright, lively and modern. From his student years he wanted to draw books for children. And when the artist had the opportunity to engage in this fascinating business seriously, real masterpieces began to appear from under his pen, one of which you are holding in your hands.
