      Of course, you know the story of a tiny girl who was born from a flower and became friends with a swallow. Thumbelina is the heroine of Andersen's fairy tale, well known to adults and children. But, if you think about it, Thumbelina can be so different! Whoever portrayed her in the pictures - timid and courageous, shy and decisive, cheerful and sad. Each artist creates his own image of a girl from a flower - and each time a new fairy tale turns out. You are holding in your hands a story told by a wonderful illustrator Anton Lomaev, who has long been known for his original and bizarre drawings for the books of famous storytellers. His pretty red-haired Thumbelina looks at the world sometimes with curiosity, sometimes with sadness, and sometimes with a shy smile. From the pages of this amazingly beautiful and colorful book, there is a floral scent, autumn breeze and early frost. Delicate colors, graceful tiny details, memorable images - these are the new illustrations by Anton Lomaev to the immortal story of Andersen.
